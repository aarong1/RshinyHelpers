# RshinyHelpers ðŸ˜™

A small package of utiility functions

## Intro ðŸ‘£
The package is a combination of utility functions for data tidying and data manipulation. That doesn't fit into any really tidy workflow.  For beginners do please see the tdiyverse packages dplyr and tidyr for data mamipulation and reformatting.

This is my first hack at creating an R package and I dont anticipate maintaining or commiting to CRAN. **Nor do I advise using in production for these reasons**  I welcome all feedback!

## Usage

### Install ðŸ‘‰

`R install_github('aarong1/RshinyHelpers')`

for the latest version
### Load in Global Namespace

`R library(Rpack)`

# Shiny



# Text tidying 

` rmPWCap(c('He1l0 ! W0rId'),rm_all_white_space = F)`
> [1] "HE1L0 W0RID"

` rmPWCap(c('He1l0 ! W0rId'),rm_all_white_space = T)`
> [1] "HE1L0W0RID" 


# Error finding

`chk_nas()
`
simply wraps which(is.na(data.frame))

`chk_dups()`

simply wraps which entries in a dataframe is duplicated `which(duplicated(data.frame))`
